* Boolean algebra
** Basic operators.
*** and operator
It is commutative and associative:
\[a\wedge b\]
*** or operator
It is commutative and associative:
\[a\vee b\]
*** negation
We can negate a variable like this:
\[\overline{a}\]
** DeMorgan Laws.
*** first rule
We have that:
\[\overline{a} \vee \overline{b} = \overline{a \wedge b}\]
*** second rule
We have that:
\[\overline{a} \wedge \overline{b} = \overline{a \vee b}\]
* Analysis I
** Symbols
*** Integral
\[\int_a^b\]
*** Derivative
\[\frac{d}{dx}\]
